log captains and the times that battles are ready, then started, then rewards are collected, then another placement period starts. essentially, I want to know which of the captains I use are the fastest and therefore will net me the most rewards.

similar to the log but I think more valuable:
ability to see the time since the last event. 
for example: "waiting for captain to start battle" since 20 minutes ago
if the captain is not live, they may not start the battle for a long time, so this should be manually abandoned
some captain do a lot while not live, though, so unless I see when the last battle ended/rewards collected/whatever, it might be a while before I notice and change to another captain.
